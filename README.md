# katas-js

## Bowling Game

This branch is for working on the bowling game kata. I'm taking the rules from here:
https://kata-log.rocks/bowling-game-kata.

To run the tests, do this:

```
npm install      # if necessary
npx jest
```

## Implementation for 2022-04-05

### Goals

Initial implementation! let's go!!!

### Reflections

- timebox is hard oof. need to set a timer!
- this code is kinda bad. better names? methods?? ugh.
- need to re-learn CJS modules
- completely wrong about immutability. oops!
- OO seems to be helping....
- in the future, look for ways to do immutability + FP
- probably remembering old implementations
- better tests? maybe?
- stick to OO for now...
- hasFrameInProgress is tricky... Maybe test it directly?
